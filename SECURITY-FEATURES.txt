# Blog Application Security Features

This document summarizes the key security features implemented in the Blog Application, focusing on the three main components:

1. **SSL/TLS with Nginx for DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting**
2. **Security Pipelines using GitHub Actions**
3. **Secrets Management and Configuration**

## 1. SSL/TLS with Nginx

The application uses Nginx as a reverse proxy with robust SSL/TLS implementation to secure communications and protect against DDoS attacks.

### Key Features:
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Encrypts all client-server communication
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: Forces secure connections
- **Modern TLS Protocol Support**: TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and brute-force attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Connection limits and traffic filtering

For detailed configuration, see [SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [NGINX-SETUP.md](./NGINX-SETUP.md).

## 2. Security Pipelines with GitHub Actions

Automated security checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Implemented Workflows:
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for vulnerable packages
- **Docker Image Security**: Scans container images using Trivy
- **Scheduled Security Monitoring**: Daily security checks

For workflow configurations, see `.github/workflows/` directory.

## 3. Secrets Management

The application implements secure management of sensitive configuration.

### Best Practices:
- **Environment Variables**: Using `.env` files (git-ignored)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive values externalized
- **Terraform Variables**: Secure cloud deployment configuration
- **Separate Environments**: Dev/staging/production separation

For more information on deployment with secure configuration, see the Terraform documentation in the `terraform` directory.
