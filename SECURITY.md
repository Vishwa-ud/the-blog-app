# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security practices and policies for the Blog App project.

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **express-validator** for robust input validation
- HTML character escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Content length limits and format validation
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM parameterized queries

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcryptjs
- Protected routes with authentication middleware
- Role-based access control (where applicable)

### 3. Database Security
- Prisma ORM with built-in SQL injection protection
- Database connection string stored in environment variables
- Proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

### 4. Docker Security
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Non-root user in containers
- Minimal base images
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy

### 5. CI/CD Security
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- CodeQL security analysis
- Dependency scanning with npm audit
- Container security scanning
- Secret scanning prevention

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-security-email@domain.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for investigation and patching
